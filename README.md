# Welcome to Personal Development at CodeYourFuture

## Why Personal Development? 

At CodeYourFuture our aim is to empower people to change their lives by giving them the tools to have a successful career in tech.

The problem lies in the fact that the students we work with face massive barriers to employment but learning tech skills alone are not enough to make them employable. These barriers interfere with students being able to engage with what we teach and learn effectively. 

These problems can manifest themselves in a variety of ways. Some may be related to their 

* Home life
* Family life
* Financial situation
* Housing situation
* Legal status
* English language skills 

in addition to their own levels of personal development.  

## What can we do? 

We developed the Personal Development Team and the PD curriculum in response to these challenges. We work in conjunction with the Education team to help students manage their learning.  But we focus on the personal aspects \(confidence, communication, teamwork\) which are key to effectively learning any new skill. 

In this website, you will find practical information about supporting our trainees with their personal development and individual circumstances.  

Depending on your interest and experience you will find a role to suit you.  Some are better for new volunteers whilst others are targeted at experienced volunteers.

This is a living document. Expect it to change and grow over time. If you'd like to suggest an enhancement or change please speak to Candy DeRoy or open a Pull Request \[link\].
