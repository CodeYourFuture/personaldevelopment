# Dyslexia and Coding

## Yay! You have started your journey with coding! 

  
It might be fun now but at some point it may become hard. 

You might belive that dyslexia makes coding is difficult and you're not smart enough.   
  
But the way a dyslexics brain works actually makes you better able to code! 

### Some inspiring innovators with dyslexia:

Remember [Steve Jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/24/dyslexia-not-a-disability-gift), the co-founder of Apple? 

What about Ingvar Kamprad? Don't know his name? He's the founder of IKEA.   
  
Ted Turner the founder of CNN

Two of the greatest scientist of all time: Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci. Einstien famously didn't talk until he was 3 years old!

British chef Jamie Oliver and Richard Branson created media empires from very humble beginnings.
