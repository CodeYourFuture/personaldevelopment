**Adjust your word-processors:**   Go to the setting in whatever word processor you use and adjust the settings that make reading easier for you. You can change the font, font size, spacing between letters. 

**Look for accessibility options on websites.** Some websites, such as Wikipedia, will allow you to change the font used throughout the pages to make text accessible to more readers. You may also find other custom presentation features.
