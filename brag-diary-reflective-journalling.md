# Brag Diary - Reflective Journalling

Throughout your training at CodeYourFuture you will be doing reflective journalling. 

### What is a Brag Diary?

Watch this [video by Gargi Sharma](https://yougotthis.io/2020-birmingham-gargi-sharma/) where she discusses the importance of ‘bragging’ about yourself and _**celebrating your achievements**_**.** 

Too often we are hard on ourselves and compare ourselves to others. 

It’s important to remember that everyone has different abilities, which is a good thing! 

Through regularly engaging with your Brag Diary, we hope you can track your self-growth and achievements on your journey with Code Your Future.

This document is personal to you and an opportunity for you to _**record your growth**_ and the skills you pick up over the next few months.    You will be building an _experience map_ for yourself. You will do this by reflecting on what you have done over the week, talking about what you have achieved, and what you have found difficult. 



### Why should I keep a Brag Diary?

A lot of work you will accomplish in the next few weeks will get forgotten and by the time you reach the end of the course. You will find it difficult to remember the skills you picked up along the way. This document ensures that does not happen. You can track what you have learned, even if it is not aligned with your goals, it is good to see the extra tasks you did and what you learned from that. Do not forget any invisible work, i.e extra hours spent on learning a new concept.   Be clear in your goals, this document will allow you to track the skills you are working on and which skills you need to perhaps work on more. Be open about your goals and share with others whilst asking for feedback. Encourage each other to share your achievements and praise the hard work and achievements of each other, no matter how small they may seem. 



### What do I need to do afterwards? 

When you meet in your Buddy Groups, take time and encourage each other to share your achievements. Praise the hard work and achievements you all have made, no matter how small they may seem.
