# Brag Diary - Reflective Journalling

Throughout your training at CodeYourFuture you will be doing reflective journalling. 



This document is personal to you and an opportunity for you to _record your growth_ and the skills you pick up over the next few months, so that when you _create your CV/resume_ and start applying for jobs, you can see how far you have come and what you have achieved, with examples.   You will be building an _experience map_ for yourself. You will do this by reflecting on what you have done over the week, talking about what you have achieved, and what you have found difficult. A lot of work you will accomplish in the next few weeks will get forgotten and by the time you reach the end of the course, you will find it difficult to remember the skills you picked up along the way. This document ensures that does not happen. You can track what you have learned, even if it is not aligned with your goals, it is good to see the extra tasks you did and what you learned from that. Do not forget any invisible work, i.e extra hours spent on learning a new concept.   Be clear in your goals, this document will allow you to track the skills you are working on and which skills you need to perhaps work on more. Be open about your goals and share with others whilst asking for feedback. Encourage each other to share your achievements and praise the hard work and achievements of each other, no matter how small they may seem. \
