        with the Trainee to encourage them in the development of relevant skills
        and attitudes for the course and future employment. The focus of the coaching
        role is on the ability to help the trainee see beyond the current situation
        and to identify what the future can look like and what needs to happen
        to help achieve this. This is helpful in setting goals and identifying
        what actions an individual needs to take next.</td>
