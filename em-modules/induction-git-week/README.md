### What do Developers do?  (20 mins)

In this section we'll explore how a professional behaves and thus how we expect trainees to behave, underscoring the name change to trainee developer

#### Exercise

1. Brainstorm together in small or large groups imagine all the day-to-day activities and behaviours of a professional software developer
   * You might want to use a Miro Board
2. Once we have we have a large list, invite them to think about whether they do all those things already
3. Discuss how to change things so they begin to do more and more of those things highlighting that practice is the way to develop
