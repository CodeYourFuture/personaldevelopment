#### **Guided Practice**

#### **Warm up activity:** **** **Conversation Starters part 1**

These questions are good for new virtual teams that are just getting to socialise and mingle with one another. These answers are opinion and preference-based, meaning group members are less likely to feel judged on their responses in the ice breaker game.

#### **In the large group: (5 mins)** ****

Choose 2- 3 of the following questions to ask.\
Write the questions in the slack channel and make a thread everyone can add to.&#x20;

Surface level questions:

* Do you want to stay the same age forever? If yes, what age would that be?
* What is your favorite possession?
* If you could grab one superpower, which one would you pick?
* Are you a morning bird or a night owl?
* Which season is your favorite? Autumn, Winter, Spring, or Summer?
* Do you prefer writing with pen and paper or digitally?
* Do you prefer large group hangouts or smaller groups?
* Would you prefer to go to the mountains or the beach?
* What is the coolest vacation you have ever taken?
* What’s your favorite food?
* Which historical figure would you want to meet?

#### **Activity 2:  **

Move on to a fun activity that’s really fast! &#x20;

#### **In smaller breakout rooms of 5 people: (2 mins max!)**

#### **5 things in 15 seconds**

First player decides on a topic and chooses a person in the group to start. That person has 15 seconds to name five specific items within the topic.

Then that player then chooses another topic and another player to continue. Continue until everyone has had a turn.&#x20;



#### **Activity 3: **

#### **Conversation Starters part 2**

You can dig deeper with 12 carefully designed questions that require team members to step out of their comfort zone, open up a bit more and be vulnerable.

#### **In smaller breakout rooms of 5 people: (5 mins max!)** **Mix up the small groups again so they can work with different people**

Choose one question to pose to the groups.&#x20;

You can ask each group the same question or give each group a different question.&#x20;

Vulnerable level questions:

* Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
* What do you want people to remember you for when you die?
* What aspect of your personality is the most valuable to those around you?
* Recall the best day of your life. Why was it the best?
* Recall the worst day of your life. Why was it so bad?
* If you could add or improve upon one characteristic of your personality, what would you add/improve?
* Who has been the most influential individual in your life thus far?
* When considering what makes you feel engaged and dedicated to work, what three characteristics do you look for in a work environment?
* Name a few things in a work environment or situation that would compel you to look for a new/future job and leave?
* What qualities and skills does a good boss/manager have in your opinion?
* What is one of your biggest goals within your personal life?
* What is your biggest accomplishment within your academic or professional life?

Now that you have the conversation going with the icebreaker activity, you can move to games and activities to build stronger team cohesion and healthy competition!

#### **Activity 4: **

#### **Simulated problem**

This activity is designed to have the team step up and brainstorm on a problem solving challenge. The scenario is designed to bring together all their experiences with CodeYourFuture since they began and the information they learned earlier in the induction day.\


#### **In smaller breakout rooms of 5 people: (15 mins)** **Mix up the small groups again so they can work with different people.**

**Scenario:**

Imagine you are going to choose the next class for CYF from the people doing Intro to Coding:  Discuss in your group and come up with your admissions criteria. Write your notes on a virtual whiteboard like the class Miro board or Google Jamboard. You will be presenting your criteria to the group at the end.\
\
What characteristics (technical or soft skills) are you looking for in the applicants?

What characteristics are you not looking for in the applicants?&#x20;

What are some of the things you need to consider when choosing who gets into the class?

After 10 mins have the groups join the large group and present their criteria.\
After the first group presents, ask the following groups to only present anything that is different from the previous group. This helps with listening skills and maintaining engagement.&#x20;

#### **Closing:** ****

Ask in the larger group how people found the activities. What did they learn from them? \


#### **Independent Practice**

These activities are examples of what you will be doing every week to get to know each other and develop a bond between. In your small Buddy groups, you will take turns choosing and leading on icebreakers for each of your weekly classes.\
It’s also good practice to start your study sessions with a fun icebreaker! \
