## **Projected Time**

About 60 minutes

* 20 minutes for Materials & Lesson
* 10 minutes for the Learning Style Quiz
* 15 minutes for group activity
* 10 minutes for "Check for Understanding"

## **Prerequisites**

* Understanding of the [Student Agreement](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/student-agreement)
* Understanding of the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/)
* Understanding of the House Rules

## **Learning styles represented**

* See \(videos and slides\)
* Hear \(videos and class discussion\)
* Write \(journal prompt to check for understanding\)
* Do \(take 1 quiz\)

## **Motivation**

CodeYourFuture is an intensive learning program whose format puts emphasis on participant-led learning, unlike a traditional classroom setting that emphasizes instructor-led learning. It's important that participants understand some common limiting beliefs about learning, and work to free themselves of these beliefs to be more successful at CYF. The tech industry is all about learning. When you open your mind to learn it gives you the freedom to work wherever you want because you learned the skills to get there! Companies like Google use the growth mindset to help their employees learn more and create cool products every day!

## **Objectives**

Participants will understand:

* Their own learning style\(s\)
* How to fix new information in their minds
* What the Growth Mindset is and how to practice it

### **Specific Knowledge Areas**

* The 4 learning styles: Auditory, Visual, Tactile, Writing
* What is academic/growth mindset
* How to fix information
* Effective learning habits

## **Materials**

* [Learning to Learn \(slides\)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1saIfR6Y7rrDu2KLwIZkTplisnQ2gcwtmsaGBukAaCZg/edit?usp=sharing)
* [What is Growth Mindset?](https://youtu.be/EyIF5VUOJc0)- Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck - animated book summary by Better Than Yesterday

## **Lesson**

### Learning Styles

[Learning Styles](https://www.learnupon.com/blog/multimodal-learning/): \(15 mins for session -go through each style; ask for questions, comments before moving on to next style of learning\)

* Most people use a combination of learning styles \(e.g Seeing, Listening, Touching, Taking notes\).
* **Visual** learning involves the use of [ infographics, cartoons and illustrations, gifs, videos, artwork, pictures and diagrams](https://www.learnupon.com/blog/create-elearning-images/) - anything that mainly stimulates your eyes. 
  * You can use techniques when studying by color coding information, using different fonts and labelling important points with stickers/stamps/emojis 
* **Auditory learning** is what we listen to. 
  * During our online classes this is key for you. So having a working microphone and internet connection are important. Group discussions/ study groups are also part of auditory learning. 
* **Kinaesthetic learning** gets you to be active. 
  * It is a combination of other types of learning like seeing hearing and doing. The act of writing code is part of kinaesthetic learning. Going forward we will ask you to create videos, vlogs, and use online tools to support this type of learning. 
* We are most familiar with **reading and writing** as ways to learn. 
  * One of the reasons we check your English level is because a lot of learning is based on your ability to read and write to a good level. This is important when you are learning a new concept you need to understand what is being expressed. When you write code even small spelling errors can make your life difficult when looking for errors! 
  * We communicate a lot by writing on Slack so we have to make sure people can understand what we are saying. This week we have reading/writing assignments for you to complete. Please let us know if these are challenging for you so we can organise support. 

#### **Recap quiz on Learning Styles**

* Take the Learning styles quiz using Kahoot [https://create.kahoot.it/share/learning-styles/069bd91c-cd5f-4fb5-b211-56eb2a8dfe92](https://create.kahoot.it/share/learning-styles/069bd91c-cd5f-4fb5-b211-56eb2a8dfe92)

#### Further Points

* Keep track during the day of the sessions that appeal to your learning style\(s\)
* Be mindful that you are helping others learn as well when you participate in a discussion/study group/ pair programming/ team project etc. 

### **Demonstration**

Watch video on [Growth Mindset](https://youtu.be/EyIF5VUOJc0) \(6 mins\) :

* As you are going through the video stop and ask questions. Check that people are understanding. 

### **Group Activity Personal discussion \(15 mins\)** 

In small groups:  Discuss a time when you overcame a struggle in learning and learned to solve a problem.  As a facilitator, share a personal story about a time you had to work hard to get better at some- thing and relate it to the video. In this story, highlight:

1. Hard work
2. Strategies
3. Help From Others

Here’s an example below of a personal story to share:

_When I was in school, I remember struggling with adding negative numbers. I had a hard time figuring out what a ‘negative’ even meant when talking about a number - how can you have less than nothing? I ended up going through many practice problems and continuing to get many of them wrong. I was a very shy kid, so I didn’t ask my teacher many questions. My thought was that I had reached ‘the peak’ of my maths talent, and it was all downhill from here. I eventually asked my mom about this topic and she explained to me the basic concept of negative numbers. This helped me understand it a little, but it was still fuzzy to me. I then researched online for some real-life contexts to show what these mysterious numbers represented outside of some abstract universe. Some of them made sense, and others didn’t. I still didn’t entirely get it and I was so frustrated that I wanted to just give up \(or continue hoping that negative numbers were not going to appear in math class ever again\). I started to dislike math simply because I couldn’t understand it anymore. Instead of entirely giving up on my academic career, I eventually mustered up the courage to ask my teacher for help as well. She explained it in a few different ways, and gave me new strategies to try out. After some practice with these new strategies, I started to solidify my understanding of negatives which allowed me to quickly pick up basic algebra afterwards. While it was a lot of work and I wanted to give up at many points during my journey, I eventually was able to ‘rewire’ my brain so that negative numbers actually made sense to me._

In a small group, ask students to share a story about a time that they made their brains smarter.

This leads to a discussion about how working hard, taking on challenges, and find- ing the right strategy can make people smarter.

### **Check for Understanding \(10 minute\)** 

Participants write a self-reflective journal entry covering:

1. What they learned about themselves
2. What from this lesson they felt challenged by
3. What from this lesson they want to learn more about 
4. What from this lesson they want to practice
