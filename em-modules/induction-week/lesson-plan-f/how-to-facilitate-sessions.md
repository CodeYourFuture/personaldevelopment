# How to facilitate FYV sessions

Plan carefully and thoroughly.

* Pay attention to learner motivation.
* Activities are not supposed to be confortable: don’t expect

  participants to start dancing in the first session. Instead,

  encourage them to take risks and push limits, of course

  respecting their own time.

* Be honest: perhaps some activities are not confortable for

  facilitators either, express it.

* Repetition is key: as more familiar with the structure and/or

  activity we are, more confortable and easier it become.

* Be flexible: you don’t need to follow the programme or

  session’s order nor fit the whole session plan in 45 minutes.

  Break it down, take time and feel free to mix & match sessions.

* Be creative: you can adapt the programme to your own style

  and propose games that you are familiar with.

* Ask for feedback: at the end of each session ask participants

  what they liked/disliked about the session. Take their feedback

  in consideration when planning next session.

  Structure:

  Welcome participants – 5 min

  Warm up / icebreakers – 10 min

  Activity – 25 min

  Closure – 5 min

  When planning sessions, leave time for each section, do not rush, and

  find a good balance.
