#### **Activity 1**

(Materials: pen and paper)

* As it is the last session of this module, invite participants to reflect on and write a paragraph about how they see themselves in a year time when the course finishes. See Futurespective activity&#x20;
* Participants are invited to read out loud.
* First they read it neutral, then facilitator suggests changing the intention using different genres like: say it as if it was a horror movie, a comedy, a romance, a documentary, etc.

Options: change the speed (as if it was on the moon –gravity - or late to work) , the volume (if it was telling a secret or making an announcement).

#### Closure

Rename to a message to themselves when course finishes E.g. Be positive, You can do it, etc.

(Invite participants to have a look at people’s messages)
