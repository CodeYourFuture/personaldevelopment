# 4 L's Retrospective

### 4Ls Retrospective: Liked, Learned, Lacked, & Longed for - from [https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/4ls](https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/4ls)

Revisit Agile Methodologies presented in PD Day 1 - Honeycomb session. \
Start the day with a [retrospective](https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/4ls) on the past 4 weeks **PD skills development only.  **

Use [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io) to do a collaborative retro session with the whole group.&#x20;

* **Liked**

What did you really enjoy about the past 4 weeks? In particular, what went better than expected? Emphasize the positive!!!

* **Learned**

What new things did the team learn during the past 4 weeks? These can be technical things (like how to make a pull request ) or nontechnical things (like how to organise effective study groups).

* **Lacked**

What things could you, the team, and the volunteers have done better during the past 4 weeks?

* **Longed for**

What things did you wish you had during the past 4 weeks that were not available? Again, these can be technical  or nontechnical (like the desire for more face time with the team).

Your retro should run between 30-60 mins depending on the size of your group.&#x20;
