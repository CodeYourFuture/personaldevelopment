# Coursework

## Critical Thinking Coursework | Social networks (Do, Read, Write)

In this assignment we will be considering and comparing Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. You do not need an account with any of these social networks in order to complete the coursework.&#x20;

#### Part 1

Complete the following table that compares the different features of the three social networks:&#x20;

_(Asking for help)_

If you are unable to complete a cell in the table you can ask for help in Slack.&#x20;

If you know the answer, don't just tell them. You should discuss how someone can find out the answer themselves.&#x20;

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| Are users asked for their date of birth when they sign up?                                               |         |          |          |
| Can an ordinary user pay money to the social network for greater access or more services?                |         |          |          |
| Is it ever possible for a user’s profile and/or messages to be viewed without logging in to the network? |         |          |          |
| Can users choose any name for their account, or are they expected to use their own name?                 |         |          |          |
| Are users informed when someone views their account?                                                     |         |          |          |

#### Part 2&#x20;

List five items of data that social media platforms know, but don't always share with account holders.&#x20;

Please state which social network(s) you are referring to for each of the five items.&#x20;

For example, in Question 1 you should have seen that not all social networks tell users when someone has looked at their account.&#x20;

Facebook &#x20;

Zoom&#x20;

LinkedIn&#x20;

Twitter

|                                                                                  | True | False |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Facebook knows how intelligent I am                                              |      |       |
| What I like on Facebook can be used to guess which political party I vote for    |      |       |

| <p>The Apply Magic Sauce tool can access every Facebook</p><p>user’s account</p> |      |       |

#### Part 4

Companies are very interested in the data provided by Apply Magic Sauce. Automated language analysis is already being used in the hiring of personnel. Click [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-knows-you-better-than-your-spouse-does/) for source.\
\
Apply Magic Sauce is an alternative machine interpretation of one’s personality based on the analysis of how a person writes a sentence in an email or the types of content they like on social media. This is great when it gets the personality traits 99% accurate. But what if it goes horribly wrong and ruins lives?\
\
Choose one thing that Apply Magic Sauce can do that you don’t like (or like the least). Describe what it is and say why you don’t like it. (250 words)&#x20;

Below are three scenarios for you to contemplate:

1. If the software wrongfully judges and jeopardises a person’s career without their knowledge?
2. Are humans unable to think for themselves and do they have to rely on machines to form a non-holistic opinion?
3. Are civilians expected to be on guard at all times and be careful of what they say and how they comment a post or tweet in a censored cyber world where everything is traceable and nothing is ever really erased?
