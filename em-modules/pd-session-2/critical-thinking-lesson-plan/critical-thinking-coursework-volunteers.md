# Critical Thinking Coursework - Volunteers

In this coursework the trainees will be considering and comparing Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. 

### Question 1 

Complete the following table that compares the different features of the three social networks: 

Please monitor Slack and see how people are asking for help and how the help is being given. Encourage trainees to be helping each other to find the answers rather than just give the answer. 

Note that many of the answers to the above are available on the Wikipedia page of the social networks. 

|  | Twitter | Facebook | LinkedIn |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Are users asked for their date of birth when they sign up? | yes | yes | yes |
| Can an ordinary user pay money to the social network for greater access or more services? | yes | yes | yes |
| Is it ever possible for a user’s profile and/or messages to be viewed without logging in to the network? | yes | yes | yes |
| Can users choose any name for their account, or are they expected to use their own name? | Any name | Expected to use real name. In practice, can get away with any name. | Any name |
| Are users informed when someone views their account? | no | No but maybe you see friends suggestion when someone views your account | Depends on setting |

### Question 2 

List five items of data that social media platforms know, but don't always share with account holders. Please state which social network\(s\) you are referring to for each of the five items. 

For example, in Question 1 you should have seen that not all social networks tell users when someone has looked at their account. 

Facebook 3 items \(ref: [dailymail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6734805/Facebook-secretly-collects-highly-sensitive-data-popular-apps.html)\)

* Receives data from at least 11 popular apps including: period-tracking app Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker, real estate app Realtor, and Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor.
* Data includes:
  * users' average weight and height to their blood pressure
  * ovulation cycles 
  * pregnancy status
* Some data are collected even if the user does not have a Facebook account.
* Apps that use Facebook’s Software Development Kit, a set of open source software tools to build apps, sends Facebook data for targeted ads without users’ knowing.
  * There is no button for App users to cancel data sharing with third parties.

Zoom and LinkedIn 1 item \(ref: [mashable](https://mashable.com/article/zoom-linkedin-data-collection/?europe=true)\)

* Zoom would take login emails and do a data mine on LinkedIn.
* This allowed other people in the meeting to view the user’s real name, employer, job title, and location.
* People could see this data by subscribing to Zoom’s LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
* On Thu 2/4/20 this facility was removed from Zoom.

Twitter 1 item \(ref; [bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-29/twitter-sold-cambridge-analytica-researcher-public-data-access)\)

* Twitter sold data access to the Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan.
* Kogan also created a personality quiz on Facebook to harvest information later used by Cambridge Analytica.
* Kogan established his own commercial enterprise, Global Science Research, which was granted a one day access in 2015 to large-scale public Twitter data, covering months of posts.

### Question 3 reading notes

Apply Magic Sauce is an alternative machine interpretation of one’s personality based on the analysis of how a person writes a sentence in an email or the types of content they like on social media. This is great when it gets the personality traits 99% accurate. But what if it goes horribly wrong and ruins lives?  


Below are three scenarios for readers to contemplate:

1. If the software wrongfully judges and jeopardises a person’s career without their knowledge?
2. Are humans unable to think for themselves and do they have to rely on machines to form a non-holistic opinion?
3. Are civilians expected to be on guard at all times and be careful of what they say and how they comment a post or tweet in a censored cyber world where everything is traceable and nothing is ever really erased?

Activities on social media do not always reflect who the person in question is as snippets of information can be taken out of context. As adaptable creatures, humans put on different personas in different situations. When dealing with a stranger face-to-face politeness is displayed. When speaking to a friend, informal language is used. When venting about a poor product on social media in order to get an open response, a less friendly tone is employed.  


Outside the office, if people cannot relax and be themselves for fear of being stalked on social media by potential employers, would this compromise business ethics and lead prospective employees to rethink what a desirable workplace feels like?

\(ii\) Choose one thing that Apply Magic Sauce can do that doesn’t concern you \(or concerns you least\). Describe what it is and say why it doesn’t bother you. \(250 words\) 

These technological advances open opportunities not only for commerce but for public health. Among those possibilities: smartphone apps may in the future recognize when a bipolar patient is slipping into a depressive phase and can inform the person’s physician.

Whilst Apply Magic Sauce is a great example of innovative technology advancement that pushes the envelope, it should be used with caution to respect privacy and allow for downtime casual chats. Further, not all social media profiles hold true information about a person and humans may also be able to manipulate the system and beat the machine.  


The fact that Apply Magic Sauce can only guess one’s traits if the Facebook account is active means it would not affect a person with a Facebook footprint. This limitation implies so long as one remains off the radar by keeping a low profile or uses a different social platform like Twitter, one might survive the personality profiling unscathed.  


Humans are imperfect but have the ability to put on a front during their working hours which allows them to perform in the job. This approach can be used on social media too, to create a social media persona, distancing one’s true self from the different opinions broadcast by friends, family and associates. With this in mind, one may be clever and play Apply Magic Sauce at its own game and it would be hard to tell what is reality and what is imagination, like the film Inception. This allows users to keep abreast of social media without getting too deeply involved and emotionally invested.When filling out one’s profile, a pseudo age could be entered. However,do act courteously and avoid being a faceless nuisance in the cyber community.

### Question 4

\(i\) Choose one thing that Apply Magic Sauce can do that you don’t like \(or like least\). Describe what it is and say why you don’t like it. \(250 words\)   


Companies are very interested in such data. Automated language analysis is already being used in the hiring of personnel. Click [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-internet-knows-you-better-than-your-spouse-does/) for source.
