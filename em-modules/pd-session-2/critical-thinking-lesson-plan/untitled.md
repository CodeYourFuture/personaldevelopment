# Critical Thinking Worksheet- Volunteers

Ask the students to read out the propositions and the arguments against them in turn. When the first one is read, lead the discussion. \


Students should agree which is the strongest and which is the weakest. They should base this on whether the statements use facts and whether they are evidence based.\


Volunteers can guide and question, but do not provide the answers. If your group suggests a different result than the one given, that’s fine. \


Answers below in italics, along with reasoning and prompts.\


## I would like a paragraph of text to be written in an image file to prevent copying

1\. In "Eyetracking Web Usability," Nielsen (2009) recommends against doing this because only 35% of people will look at it.\


3\. Search engines don't read images so they'll ignore any text in images.\


2\. This is a stupid idea. Why would you do that?\


\#1 Is based in fact and quotes a source of evidence. The author ran their own tests to produce the result quoted.\


\#3 Is true, but there is no support for the statement - it is merely stated as a fact.\


\#2 This uses no facts and is close to telling the person themself that they are stupid. Maybe ask how the students would feel if someone said this to them

## Sometimes it is easier to leave html tags open, just in case

2\. Closing all your tags is a W3C specification. So, not closing your tags is invalid under standards.\


3\. I think it’s a lot more difficult to find errors if you don’t close your tags\


1\. Everyone knows that’s not how html works!\


\#2 Is correct and the evidence given is good. Maybe ask your students what they know about W3C specification\


\#3 Undoubtedly true, but no evidence is given why this is the case\


\#1 Donald Trump style argument. This is close to bullying.

## I’d like the navigation bar at the bottom of the page

3\. Don Norman lists visibility and consistency as two of the key principles of good web design. This would break both of them.\


1\. That will make it impossible to create drop down menus from the navigation bar.\


2\. That’s not going to work, html won’t let me do it.\


\#3 Don Norman’s the Design of Everyday Things does state this. It is also a credible source. If you have time then ask students how they would check whether the source is credible, and if the statement is correct.\


\#1 It will certainly make it tricky! Has the client asked for drop down menus? It’s a reasonable argument, but no evidence is given.\


\#2 This is untrue. How ethical is it to use an argument like this? Not factual and no evidence is given\
