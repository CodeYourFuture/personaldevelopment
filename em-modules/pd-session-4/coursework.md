# Coursework

## Resilience (Read, Write,&#x20;

1. In your Learning Journal, write down achievements that you are most proud of. Write why you feel proud and what did you to to achieve those things.&#x20;
2. Post one of your achievements in your student area on Google Classroom.&#x20;



**Find Something Funny Activity (Do over the course of the week) **

Laughter has been found to boost resilience. A study evaluating humor induced [**positive psychology interventions**](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-psychology-interventions/) identified the benefits of incorporating daily humor activities to induce laughter reduced depression and increased joy for participants, even months later (Wellenzohn, et. al., 2016).

Spend 10 minutes each day for 7 days on the following exercise:

1. Write down the three of the funniest things you have experienced, seen, or heard that day. Provide detail and note how they made you feel. If you can’t think of anything, do an online search for funny stories or anecdotes. Social media can be a good source for funny material.&#x20;
2. Write down why you found it funny. The more specific you are, the more effective the exercise will be.&#x20;
3. Write these three funny things at the end of your day. Doing so will foster a new [**habit**](https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-exercises/) and may help you absorb the emotion more as you are going to sleep.

## Roles in Tech (Do, Read, Write)‌

1. On your own, choose 3 to 5 roles from the session that sound interesting to you and do some research on Google and YouTube about those roles. Write down a few notes about each role, such as what interests you, what you might like about that role, what questions you have about the role, etc.
2. Of the roles you researched, choose the top 2 or 3 that really stand out to you. Using LinkedIn, find 2 or 3 people who work in your area doing the jobs you're interested in. Reach out to them and ask for an informational interview using the template we came up with during the Group Practice activity. **(Do not sign up for LinkedIn Premium Free trial right now!!!

3. Go to 2 to 4 informational interviews within the next 4 weeks and take notes on your conversations.  Be ready to share your notes with the group in your Buddy groups or in our next PD Day.
