Welcome!

Just to make sure that you can hear me, give me thumbs up IF you can hear me?

Ok good most of you can.

This session on resiliency and dealing with job rejections.

This session will be led by \[names of facilitators\].

Other facilitators - Give a wave

 This workshop is about how developers deal with the challenge of looking for jobs and dealing with rejection. We will share our experiences with you about this aspect of the job application process.

#### **Slide 2 \(8 min\)**

This is the agenda for today. We will spend few minutes to introduce the workshop hosts

Then we will introduce the workshop and its aims

Following that we will go into breakout rooms

Then we will re-group and wrap up the session

At this point in the course you might be thinking about getting a job. During our next PD day we will go through the whole job process as a CodeYourFuture Trainee.   Today we will be looking at a skill all developers need, not just for getting jobs, but all the time. \

When you start going for your first role after CYF you will need to apply for a lot of roles. The reality is that for some of you it will not be a smooth process and you will have to try several times before you can land your first job. You will face rejection.   The aim of this workshop is to prepare you for those knockbacks where things don’t go your way. Hopefully, by the end of this session you will feel better able to deal with those types of situations.

\[Introduce yourself and your professional background\]  Talk about how you got the job in your first role in tech. How many times you had to apply. How many rejections you had.

#### **Slide 3 \(2 min\)**

In a minute we will go into breakout rooms to discuss what resilience means to you.

And why it’s important to have resilience.

Remember this is an INTERACTIVE session where you offer your ideas and opinions.

#### **Slide 5 \(5-7 mins\)** **Breakout rooms**

Write answers on Google Jamboard or Miro board

**Discussion**: What does Resilience mean to you? No right or wrong answer.

Official Definition: “The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties”

**Discussion**: Why is it important to have resilience?   **Discussion**: How have you shown resilience in the past when you have faced challenges?

#### **Slide 6 -7 \(15 mins\) Main room**

Now that all of us have your definitions of resilience and what it means to you, lets see how we can develop a resilient mindset

What does it mean to be resilient as a professional developer?

Let’s look at how you can develop a resilient mindset. Give time for discussion after each. Make sure trainees have a chance to give examples of how they can do this.

1. Look at your own achievements - look at what you have achieved already to get here. Your life experiences are full of examples of resilience and achievement. 
2. Focus on things in your control - focus on the aspects that you can control, make sure you apply for the right type of job at the right time. 
3. Embrace rejection - Rejection is part of the process. There is so much you can learn from making mistakes and things not going your way.
4. Employers need you as much as you need them. - It’s a 2 way process. The employer is lucky to have you!
5. You’re not on your own - You have a ready-made support network at CYF. The volunteers, your mentors, the teachers and you have each other. 
6. Apply when you are ready. -. You will know you are ready by talking to CYF, to your Edu buddies, PD team  and talking to your mentors. If you apply too early or when you are unprepared, you are more likely to get rejections.

#### **Slide 8 \(5 mins\) Wrap up**

Group discussion about - any clarifying questions / issues

Discuss the common misconceptions

#### **Common Mistakes / Misconceptions**

‌Whatever topic you are presenting, make sure you address the negative thinking that some people may have.

1. It’s too early for me to start thinking about getting a job. I’m not ready to apply. 
2. I have enough technical skills now, I don’t need to wait until the end of the course to apply for jobs.
3. I’m used to being rejected from jobs. What is going to change for me this time?‌

#### **Guided Practice**

Notes in the slides

#### **Independent Practice**

1. Write down achievements that you are most proud of.
2. **Find Something Funny Activity**

   Laughter has been found to boost resilience. A study evaluating humor induced [**positive psychology interventions**](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-psychology-interventions/) identified the benefits of incorporating daily humor activities to induce laughter reduced depression and increased joy for participants, even months later \(Wellenzohn, et. al., 2016\).

Spend 10 minutes each day for 7 days on the following exercise:

1. Write down the three of the funniest things you have experienced, seen, or heard that day. Provide detail and note how they made you feel. If you can’t think of anything, do an online search for funny stories or anecdotes. Social media can be a good source for funny material. \
2. Write down why you found it funny. The more specific you are, the more effective the exercise will be. \
3. Write these three funny things at the end of your day. Doing so will foster a new [**habit**](https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-exercises/) and may help you absorb the emotion more as you are going to sleep.
