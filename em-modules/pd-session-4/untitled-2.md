‌**Teaching notes and walkthrough **

#### **Slides**

All guidance is provided in the Presenter Notes

Describe the main idea being shown in the slides.

Don’t just repeat what is on the slides.

Clarify definitions

Give examples you have seen or experienced

‌‌**Common Mistakes / Misconceptions**

Whatever topic you are presenting make sure you address the negative thinking that some people may have e.g.,

1. This is not relevant to me&#x20;
2. I don’t have to learn this now
3. I’ll only be a junior so I won’t be able to change anything&#x20;

‌**Guided Practice**

All guidance is provided in the Presenter Notes

#### **Independent Practice**

Trainees pair-off with a classmate that has a different work style to theirs (Leadership Compass)

They then ‘[pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AvHZEvbPqtUAN1qs4Xtl3gDEpM8y-my\_BYzuVdBC-Lo/edit?usp=sharing)’ to each other their goals, problems/challenges, and what action they have taken so far and what help they still need.

They must use the [Active Listening skills](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y8pv9U8QSsygDnDRKG0GM5zArGtGeq9KX6KOWqTXhZI/edit?usp=sharing), and then spend time individually taking action to address of resolve their partner’s problems/challenges, and prepare a one-minute pitch (PD Class Pitching Skills)
