# Coursework

### Interview Questions 

You’ve made a start on your STAR spreadsheet in class. 

Now, expand on what you’ve done so far and create a STAR answer for each question asked. You’ll use these answers for your interview practice task.

Here’s the spreadsheet, if you haven’t already made a copy.

DO NOT edit the spreadsheet directly. See instructions on first tab.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvPFFewdrVP7nY7sL7l13TeGUxLos7h3NxWb0itxm84/edit\#gid=682286418](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvPFFewdrVP7nY7sL7l13TeGUxLos7h3NxWb0itxm84/edit#gid=682286418)

Instructions are on the first tab, questions are on the second tab.

Use this spreadsheet to start having discussions with your PD buddy. For example, to get their thoughts on your answers and where you might be able to improve them. 

### **Interview practice**

This is where you will practice being interviewed using the questions from the STAR spreadsheet. 

In groups of three, arrange a video call where you can practice being interviewed by each other, using a selection of those questions \(and any others you’d like to ask\).

One person will do the interview, one person will be interviewed and the third person will observe - and give feedback on how well the interviewee did. 

Then swap round until you’ve all had a chance to be interviewed.

Use this document from class to help you with the process of interviewing each other. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5AQ9En57zJRikQ1GFptFgIw-XMfbGox/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A5AQ9En57zJRikQ1GFptFgIw-XMfbGox/edit)
