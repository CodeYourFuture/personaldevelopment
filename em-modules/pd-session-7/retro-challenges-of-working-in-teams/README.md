# Retro - Challenges of Working in Teams Futurepective

As the trainees will be going into Final Projects, we will  use a retrospectives as the new team is assembled. This kind of retrospective is called a futurespective: A retrospective where you start from the goal and explore ways for getting there.

**How to do a futurespective**

In a futurespective teams places themselves in the future by imagining that their goal has been reached. They start such a retrospectives by discussing the team goals to ensure that team members build a common understanding.  The goals are formulated and written down so that they are visible for everybody.

Optionally teams can write down which benefits they got from reaching their goals. If teams likes to party they can even do a small celebration for having reached the goals, which can help to make teams aware of the importance of reaching it.

Next teams discuss their imaginary past and explore how they have gotten to their goals. There are two things that that teams question themselves:

* What are the things that have helped us to get here?
* Which things made it hard for us to reach our goal?

Optionally teams can also discuss:

* What did we learn as team along the way towards reaching our goal?

Teams can use sticky notes, flip-overs and/or white boards to capture the results from the discussions. When you do the [exercise with remote teams](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/retrospectives-in-remote-teams/) you can use a Google Doc or tools like [Lino](http://en.linoit.com/) or [Groupmap](http://www.groupmap.com/).

Now the teams go back to the present. The results from exploring the past are used to agree how to work together in teams to reach the goal. This can for example be done by:

* Defining a Definition of Done.
* Making a list of tools that will be used, processes/practices that teams will use, etc.
* Defining actions that are needed to work together effectively.

A good practice is to make the [decisions and actions visible](https://www.benlinders.com/2011/communication-making-quality-process-improvement-visible/), e.g. by posting them on the team’s taskboards or putting them on the wall at the team’s workspace.

Be careful to not have too many actions coming out of the retrospective. It helps when teams agree to only do the [Vital Few Actions](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/retrospective-exercise-vital-few-actions/) that are needed now to get started. There will be more retrospectives where teams can reflect and define those actions that will be most valuable to do at that time.

**Imagining the past**

Discussing the past can initially feel somewhat strange for teams. Since teams haven’t reached their goals yet, they won’t have any facts or things that have actually happened.

So how can you explore an imaginary past? Here are some techniques that you can use:

* Brainstorming: Team members come up with ideas on what might help or hinder them to reach the goal.
* Storytelling: “Once upon a time there was a team that wanted to reach a goal. Along the way they had several things which helped them, but there were also some barriers …”.
* Experiences from previous projects: Team members can tell about things they did or learned from earlier projects and share learnings of what worked or didn’t work.
* [Angel’s Advocate](https://www.benlinders.com/2011/devils-or-angels-advocate-which-role-do-you-prefer/): One team member come up with a thing that helped, other team members build on this by saying what they like about it and add things to support it.
* Fearless change journey: This is a game teams can play to find their way towards a goal and learn to deal with impediments along the way. For a write-up how this game was played at the OOP 2015 conference, see [Playing the Fearless Journey Game](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/02/fearless-journey-game).

These are some ways that facilitators can stimulate creative thinking and help teams to find things that can help them to reach their goals.

**Retrospectives help teams to grow and improve**

A futurespectives is on of the [many exercises](https://www.benlinders.com/2013/have-a-toolbox-of-retrospective-techniques/) that you can use to [spice up your agile retrospectives](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/spice-up-your-agile-retrospectives/).  Retrospective deliver many benefits: They give [power to teams](https://www.benlinders.com/2013/retrospective-benefits-power-to-the-team/), enable [teams to do their own actions](https://www.benlinders.com/2013/retrospective-benefits-action-by-the-team/) and to do [sustainable improvement](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/retrospective-benefits-changes-that-stick/).  
  
There are various ways to run a Futurespective  


### Here are 3 versions you can try [https://metroretro.io/blog/what-is-a-futurespective](https://metroretro.io/blog/what-is-a-futurespective) 

#### 1. Hopes and Concerns

Hopes and Concerns is a lightweight futurespective template

The Hopes and Concerns exercise asks team members to open up and communicate what they’re optimistic or worried about. Reviewing the Hopes together is motivating for the group, who can then use that energy to collectively address the Concerns. This exercise is great for the beginning of a workshop.



#### 2. The sailboat futurespective

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef3109807a3938491cecdfd/5f3170dfe0a2e4670f2b58eb_Sailboat%20futurespective.PNG)

The Sailboat - how does your team get to their tropical island?

Get the team to work from the goal backwards \(in this case the tropical island is your goal\), then focus on the things that help and prevent the team’s boat from reaching the island.



#### 3. The newspaper headline futurespective

![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef3109807a3938491cecdfd/5f3a9dd24fdb90af0aece398_Newspaper.jpg)

The ‘News Headline’ is a creative futurespective - imagine a future where a newspaper is reporting the team’s success on their front page. To run this futurespective, split the group into small teams and have them create:

* The Headline - what’s the snappy title that conveys their success?
* Lead picture - choose or create an image, maybe you’ll allow a GIF or two.
* Bullet points and the first few paragraphs - go into detail here, what is the success story? What did the team overcome to get here?

### This is a Futurespective best run in a face to face environment!

* Set the Scene and Create a Timeline: group agrees on a set timeline to focus on 
* No Safety Check: encourage creativity rather than making sure everyone feels safe 
* Step into the Future: traverse the timeline and fill in with events 
* Look back at the past negatively \(skip to positive if short on time\):
* State interrupt – break the mood!
* Step forward into the future again
* Look back at the past positively
* Dot-vote
* Create actions
