‌**Teaching notes and walkthrough** 

#### **Slides**

All guidance is provided in the Presenter Notes

Describe the main idea being shown in the slides.

Don’t just repeat what is on the slides.

Clarify definitions

Give examples you have seen or experienced

‌‌**Common Mistakes / Misconceptions**

Whatever topic you are presenting make sure you address the negative thinking that some people may have e.g.,

1. This is not relevant to me 
2. I don’t have to learn this now
3. I’ll only be a junior so I won’t be able to change anything 

‌**Guided Practice**

All guidance is provided in the Presenter Notes

#### **Independent Practice**

Trainees pair-off with a classmate that has a different work style to theirs \(Leadership Compass\)

They then ‘[pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AvHZEvbPqtUAN1qs4Xtl3gDEpM8y-my_BYzuVdBC-Lo/edit?usp=sharing)’ to each other a problem, and what action they have taken so far and what help they still need.

They must use the [Active Listening skills](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y8pv9U8QSsygDnDRKG0GM5zArGtGeq9KX6KOWqTXhZI/edit?usp=sharing), and then apply the 5 Why’s technique to discover the root cause of the problem. They should then present this to the class at the next PD lesson.
