# Exploring Personal Interests Activities

These activities will enable you to learn more about your students by helping them identify their interests, their opinions on a wide range of topics, and their likes and dislikes. One of the best ways to connect with people is to talk about things that interest them. Hopefully these activities will give you some ideas for communicating with your student.
