# Required English Language Level

The CodeYourFuture aim is to train people for a career in tech. 

We use the UK requirements for English language proficiency as the standard that all graduates should meet or be working toward meeting.  

Trainees and grads should be able to prove their ability to read, write and speak to at least level B1 of the Common European Framework of reference for Languages \(CFER\) scale. 

This means that they are an Independent User who:  

**‘Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes & ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.’**
