The Personal development coursework is also aimed at improving reading and writing skills through reflective journal writing. Trainees get feedback from their PD Buddies on the quality of their written assignments. They gain practice in speaking and listening through various activities delivered during the PD Days. These take place every three weeks during the course. The coursework can be viewed here: [https://personaldevelopment.codeyourfuture.io/sessions/pd-coursework-assignments](https://personaldevelopment.codeyourfuture.io/sessions/pd-coursework-assignments)

Within the CYF community there are regular language exchange meetings. Language learners can practice English and share other languages. The schedule and sign up can be found in the Slack channel **\# cyf-language-exchange-pilot**
