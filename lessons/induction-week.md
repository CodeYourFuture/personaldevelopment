# Induction Week - PD Session 1

## Session 1

### From Students to Trainees \(5 mins\)

Introduce the concept of them progressing from being students on the Intro to Coding and Fundamentals courses to being _**Trainees**_ on the Full stack Course. 

* **During PD days we will be highlighting appropriate professional behaviours and attitudes.** 
* **Have the group take 1 minute to think of their definition of a 'student' and that of a 'trainee' \(no Googling!\)** 
* **Write them on a space set up with two columns on your class Miro board**
* **Ask them to highlight which word they feel more closely embodies a professional person**
* **End by saying ‘you are a trainee, that means you are training to be a professional. Thus you should behave in a professional way’.**
