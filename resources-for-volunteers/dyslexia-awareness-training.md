# Dyslexia Awareness Training

## Reasonable adjustments when teaching and mentoring

In the UK Dyslexia is classified as a disability under the Equality Act 2010. We have a duty to provide reasonable adjustments for our disabled learners. So they can participate fully in their education and our community.
