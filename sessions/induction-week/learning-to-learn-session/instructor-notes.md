## \*\*\*\*[**Learning Styles - Notes**](lesson.md#learning-styles)\*\*\*\*

* ‘I only have one learning style.’
  * Most people make use of several learning styles. Sometimes they rely heavily on one over others.
* ‘If i just put my head down and work hard I will learn what I need to know.’
  * Knowing where and when to put your energy will make your learning more effective and hopefully enjoyable.

### **Common Mistakes / Misconceptions to highlight**

* "I'm not good at learning new things because I didn't get good grades in school." Ability to learn and grades earned in school are not strongly correlated. Grades reflect other things in addition to learning \(persistence, ability to obtain help, ability to spend time on assignments, support at home, etc.\)
* "As long as I have a growth mindset, learning new things will be easy." A growth mindset allows you to be kinder to and more patient with yourself when learning new things. Learning new things is often quite challenging, regardless of your mindset.
  * **Fixing Information in your mind**:
    * Understanding that something is important is not enough on its own.    
    * Hands-on practice truly helps you to grasp the concepts, it helps you to automate the knowledge which you've acquired.
    * Take breaks while learning or studying to alternate between [focused and diffused mode](https://www.7pace.com/blog/focused-vs-diffuse-thinking).
    * Test yourself during the studying process by looking away and trying to recall what you just studied.
    * Revisit topics that you've learned so far, repetition helps fix the material in your mind.
  * **Effective Learning techniques:**
    * Use different techniques to activate different ways of learning remember VARK \(visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic\)
    * Active learning is more effective than passive learning
  * Passive learning: reading about something, watching a video, listening to a lecture
  * Active learning: completing exercises, code-along \(typing the same thing as in a video\), making notes in a lesson, drawing a diagram, 
* **Don't cram all of your studying into 1 day, it's less effective**
  * Try to spread it out over multiple days
  * When studying try switching between different topics \(e.g. review this week's class, then last week's exercises\)
* **Make notes and review them during the week**
  * Use your notes to draw diagrams that explain concepts
  * Try making flash cards: a question one side, the answer on the other
* **Explain how and why something works to yourself or to a friend**
  * Try to think of real-life examples
* **Get enough sleep**
  * Your ability to think drops by 25% for each 24 hours you’re awake
  * Make a to do list and prioritise what you need to do first \(not just things to study!\)
* **Don't try to multitask when studying**
  * Turn off distractions and focus
  * Use the Pomodoro Method you learned about in the Coursera Learning How to Learn course. Set a timer for 20-25 mins, work for that time and then give yourself a 5-10 min break. Then reset the timer and go for another cycle. Repeat until you have finished your task.  [https://pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io)
