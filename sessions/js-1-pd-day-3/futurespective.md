# Futurespective



In her blog Liz Keog describes the steps she takes to run a futurespective:

* Set the Scene and Create a Timeline: group agrees on a set timeline to focus on 
* No Safety Check: encourage creativity rather than making sure everyone feels safe 
* Step into the Future: traverse the timeline and fill in with events 
* Look back at the past negatively \(skip to positive if short on time\):
* State interrupt – break the mood!
* Step forward into the future again
* Look back at the past positively
* Dot-vote
* Create actions
