# Retro - What's your Superpower?

In the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) by Diana Larsen and Esther Derby, the authors explain a retrospective as having the following steps:

* Set the Stage: make sure everyone feels safe and is in in the retro
* Gather The Data: what happened, make sure everyone has the same picture
* Generate Insights: analyze the data to find root causes
* Decide What To Do: what are experiments that could help us to improve [1% a day](https://agilestrides.com/blog/113-practices-of-extreme-programming-applied-to-management/)
* Closing: donâ€™t just walk away but close the retro with an activity





#### Your Superpower

This is an activity you can use in a retro with Superheroes as a theme. The first question is, what is your superpower? Which skill or competence do you bring with you to the team?

Ask the people to write their superpower on a sticky note and in short explain it when necessary.
