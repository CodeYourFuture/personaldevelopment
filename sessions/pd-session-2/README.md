## Session 1 \(30 mins- 1 hour\)

### 4Ls Retrospective: Liked, Learned, Lacked, & Longed For

Revisit Agile Methodologies presented in PD Day 1 - Honeycomb session.   
Start the day with a [retrospective](https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/4ls) on the past 4 weeks PD skills development. 

Use [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io/) to do a collaborative retro session with the whole group. 

* **Liked**

What did you really enjoy about the past 4 weeks? In particular, what went better than expected? Emphasize the positive!!!

* **Learned**

What new things did the team learn during the past 4 weeks? These can be technical things \(like how to make a pull request \) or nontechnical things \(like how to organise effective study groups\).

* **Lacked**

What things could you, the team, the volunteers  have done better during the past 4 weeks?

* **Longed for**

What things did you wish to have during the past 4 weeks that were not available? Again, these can be technical  or nontechnical \(like the desire for more face time with the team\).

Your retro should run between 30-60 mins depending on the size of your group. 

## Session 2 \(30 mins\)

### Honeycomb Feedback

Now build on the information gained during the retro and evaluate the feedback given to you for the 'Working with my team' cell

Look at your feedback results and discuss in your Buddy groups if you have develped the habits in this cell. 

If you do not have enough feedback then you need to ask more people to give you feedback before you can move on to another Honeycomb cell. 

If you have enough feedback and feel like you are ready to move on the next cell, then the you will be introduced to your next set of habits.
