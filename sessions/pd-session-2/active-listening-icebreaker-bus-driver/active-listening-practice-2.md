# Active Listening Practice 2

#### **Stop listening exercise- Online version** 

You will need two facilitators for this activity.   
Divide into two groups A & B  
Keep half the group \(A\) in the main room and put the other half \(B\) in another break out room.    
  
**Group A Instructions**   
After Group B moves to their breakout room, give Group A their instructions:  
We will be practicing active listening in pairs and you are going to be the speaker. Think of a topic you are really passionate about/interested in - eg family, films, football team etc. and talk about that for 2 mins with your partner. They will be listening to you but not talking. We will bring you back to the main room after about 2 minutes. 

  
**Group B Instructions**  
After moving to their breakout room, Give Group B their instructions:   
You will partner with one other person. When you two join your breakout room, your partner will start talking about a topic. You will be practicing your active listening \(not talking!\) but after about 30 seconds stop listening to your partner and see what happens. What ways can you show non listening to your partner?   
We will bring you back to the main room after about 2 minutes.   
  
Once both groups are prepped, pair A's and B's and send the pairs to their breakout rooms. Keep track of the time and make sure you bring them back to the main room after about 2 mins. 

**Debrief:**   
Bring all the pairs back together in the main room.   
Have a discussion about the activity.   
Ask the A's what it was like to be listened to attentively.   
Then ask what it was like to not be listened to.   
Ask the B's what did they notice about their partner when they stopped listening? What did their partner say? What did their partner do?   
Lead on to brainstorm about the impact of listening and how to listen attentively.    
  
**Stop listening exercise - Face to face in real ife version**

You will need two facilitators for this activity.   
Divide into two groups A & B  
Keep half the group \(A\) in the main room and take the other half group \(B\) outside the room.   
  
**Group A Instructions**   
After Group B moves outside the room, give Group A their instructions:  
We will be practicing active listening in pairs and you are going to be the speaker. Think of a topic you are really passionate about/interested in - eg family, films, football team etc. and talk about that for 2 mins with your partner. They will be listening to you but not talking. You will do this for about 2 minutes. 

  
**Group B Instructions**  
After moving outside the room, Give Group B their instructions:   
You will partner with one other person. When you two pair up, your partner will start talking about a topic. You will be practicing your active listening \(not talking!\) but after about 30 seconds stop listening to your partner and see what happens. What ways can you show non listening to your partner?   
You will do this for about 2 minutes.   
  
Once both groups are prepped, bring the B's back to the room. Have the A's and B's pair up to listen actively to the story.  It will get noisy! Keep track of the time and make sure you bring them all together after about 2 mins. 

**Debrief:**   
  
Have a discussion about the activity.   
Ask the A's what it was like to be listened to attentively.   
Then ask what it was like to not be listened to.   
Ask the B's what did they notice about their partner when they stopped listening? What did their partner say? What did their partner do? Usually the speakers get really frustrated and annoyed.   
Lead on to brainstorm about the impact of listening and how to listen attentively.
