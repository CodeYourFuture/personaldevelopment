Facebook has a huge amount of data on you - whose profiles you engage with, how much time you spend on it, and everything you've said in a message. It uses this data to build up a picture of who you are, which it can then us to customise your News Feed and target adverts.

But just one dataset - what you've 'liked' - can reveal a lot about a person on its own. The University of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre has built a tool that uses your likes, and no other data, to build up a picture of your personality.

The ["Apply Magic Sauce" tool](http://applymagicsauce.com/you.html) uses the [Facebook](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/) likes to estimate your gender, intelligence, life satisfaction, sexual preference and political and religious preferences, as well as guessing at your education and relationship status.

It also puts you on spectra for the "Big 5" personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. These tell you, for example, wheter you are impulsive or organised, conservative or liberal and so on.

You can also follow links to take further personality tests on the University of Cambridge website.

This is a tool from the researchers, rather than Facebook, but it shows the picture of you that the social network can build just based on your activity. In reality, likes are only a fraction of the information Facebook has on you.

For example, Facebook already has your gender details, activity, name, relationship status and so on.

#### To take the test

Visit the [Apply Magic Sauce website here](http://applymagicsauce.com/you.html) and select "Try it Out".

You'll be asked to log in via Facebook. The website says it only collects your profile's LikeIDs, but will not store any of your information once the test is complete.

Once you've logged in to your Facebook account, it shows the results. You can take further tests to narrow your personality down further, and in some cases see how you compare to the average.
