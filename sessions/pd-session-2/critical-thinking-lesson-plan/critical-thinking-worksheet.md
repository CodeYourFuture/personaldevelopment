# Critical Thinking Worksheet- Trainees

One at a time, read the following three statements. Then read the arguments against them. Order the statements based on which of them has the best argument against the statement.  


Discuss what makes the arguments good, bad or in the middle.   


Remember to discuss:  


Is the argument is based in fact or feelings? 

Does the argument have any evidence to support it?   


## I would like a paragraph of text to be written in an image file to prevent copying

1. In "[Eyetracking Web Usability](https://www.amazon.com/Eyetracking-Web-Usability-Jakob-Nielsen/dp/0321498364)" Nielsen \(2009\) recommends against doing this because only 35% of people will look at it.  


2. This is a stupid idea. Why would you do that?  


3. Search engines don't read images so they'll ignore any text in images.  


## Sometimes it is easier to leave html tags open, just in case

1. Everyone knows that’s not how html works!  


2. Closing all your tags is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/index.html). So, not closing your tags is invalid under standards.  


3. I think it’s a lot more difficult to find errors if you don’t close your tags  
  


## I’d like the navigation bar at the bottom of the page

1. That will make it impossible to create drop down menus from the navigation bar.  


2. That’s not going to work, html won’t let me do it.  


3. [Don Norman \(1998\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) lists visibility and consistency as two of the key principles of good web design. This would break both of them.
