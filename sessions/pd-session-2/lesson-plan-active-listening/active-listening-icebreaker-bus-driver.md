# Active Listening Icebreaker

### **Bus driver exercise**

* Tell the group that you will be asking questions on what they are about to hear and that they can take notes if they wish.
* Start by saying you are the bus driver.
* You then read out a bus route, for example:  You are the bus driver at stop no 1, three people got on the bus, one of them was wearing a red hat.
* At stop 2, four people got on and one got off.
* At stop 3, two people got on, one person was carring a bag and the person with the red hat got off.
* Continue adding stops with more people and details. 
* When you have finished you ask the question: What is the bus drivers age? The majority of people will not have heard the opening line: "you are bus driver".
