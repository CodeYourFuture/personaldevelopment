Slides 1- 5

Diversity is an action and inclusion is a collective experience. Both is more powerful than either are on their own.

Does it matter? Yes! Diverse voices = increased creativity, new ideas, greater variety of perspectives and solutions to problems

Slides 6- 8

Unconscious bias \(also known as implicit bias\) - a social stereotype about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. These biases may include that instinctive categorisation of others such as age, weight, skin color, gender, educational level, disability, sexuality, accent, social status, and job title.

* Example: Name on a CV or resume sets the first impression, affecting the likelihood of getting hired

**Slides 9-11**

**In Groups / Outgroups** 

**Slides 12- 15** 

Privilege - generally "unearned" social advantage \(born with, given\). Social advantages include education, mental health, child care, race, religion, family structure, access to transportation.

* Example: Christian privilege means that holidays such as Christmas are recognised and practiced in December.

**Covering**  


**Staff from diverse backgrounds may try to assimilate by becoming part of the company culture. Trying to fit in.  
  
They do this in the following ways:**  


**Appearance- trying to blend into the mainstream through how you present yourself  including how you dress, how you cut or style your hair. A staff member with natural hair might start straightening it.** 

**Affiliation: avoiding behaviors widely associated with their identity, culture, or group. A staff member might avoid bringing food from their home country to eat for lunch.** 

**Advocacy -  avoid sticking up for their group.  A LGBT staff member might not speak up for trans rights.**

**Association - Avoiding people who are in the groups you are trying to cover. A staff member might avoid the support staff of the company like cleaners or cooks who are in the same group**  
  


**Can anyone think of a type of covering they might do?**   


**Companies need to work to make a culture where people’s differences are celebrated and staff don’t feel ashamed to show they are part of a particular group.**

iii\) Allyship - a member of a social group that enjoys some privilege that is working to end oppression and understand their own privilege. In other words, an ally is anyone who supports or empowers another marginalized person or group.

* Good practices: know the issues and know yourself \(and your biases\); understand that you can make mistakes too; listen more and speak less; do not expect to be educated by others \(do the research yourself\); be accountable for mistakes; our needs are secondary to the group that you seek to work with
* Examples: Ensuring inclusivity on lunch/dinner invitations; stopping an inappropriate joke; encouraging broad participation in team discussion

iv\) Microaggressions - a comment or action that subtly and often unconsciously or unintentionally expresses a prejudiced attitude toward a member of a marginalised group. Examples include, 'You sound really articulate' or 'Do you even know what TikToc is'?

* When you are the target: Criticise the microaggression, not the microaggressor, by explaining how the statement or behavior made you feel.
* When you are the microaggressor: Try not to be defensive - the person is taking a risk by sharing the information; acknowledge the other person's hurt and apologise.

v\) Empathy - a person's ability to recognise and share emotions of another; involves, first, seeing someone else’s situation from their perspective, and, second, sharing their emotions, including, if any, their distress

vi\) Strategies to combat - Understand the context and evaluate your options; address the inappropriate comment; take care of yourself.

#### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

1. That YOU do not have any biases.
2. That you will not encounter any biases at your workplace or during your daily routine. Be prepared to either step away or use strategies that can help inform the person from making another mistake.

#### Guided Practice

From each of the concepts from the lesson, break into small groups and imagine where you stand \(can be the concept itself or an action, behavior, or situation\). 

Think of ways a company can be more inclusive at the workplace.

#### Independent Practice

Think of when you are stressed, feeling tired, rushed, as these situations tend to activate our biases. How may these feelings influence your behavior when working with a group? 

#### Challenge

Take an Implicit Association Test \(IAT\) here \([https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)\) to identify what your unconscious biases are!

There are multiple topics to choose from: Age, Gender, Sexuality, Skin-tone, Ethnicity, etc.

Remember: Awareness is the first step to combatting bias.
