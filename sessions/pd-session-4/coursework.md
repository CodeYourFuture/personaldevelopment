# Coursework

## Confidence

Take the [MindTools Self Confidence Assessment](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_84.htm)

Based on your score do you need to **Build** Your Self Confidence, **Improve** Your Self Confidence or **Nurture** Your Self Confidence? 

Write in your Learning Journal/ Diary what steps you will take to build, improve or nurture your self confidence. 

#### 

In your Learning Journal/Diary answer the following questions:

* What is trust?How important is it in our lives?
* What did a recent survey by kaplanprofessional say about trust?
* Why do we need to be confident in the workspace?
* What do you realise that causes low confidence in you?
* What is SWOT ?
* What is the difference between Rational Thinking / Positive Thinking?
* What does Bernice Moore's Theory says?
* Follow the steps for SOS \(Stop, Observe, Shift\), the negative self-talk stopping technique. Also explain the concept of impostor syndrome for awareness!

   * what worries you
   * how you’ll beat that 
   * what you’ll achieve

2. Pair-off with another trainee that has a different work-style to yours based on the Leadership Compass.
