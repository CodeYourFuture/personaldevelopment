# Coursework

## Resilience

1. In your Learning Journal, write down achievements that you are most proud of.



1. **Find Something Funny Activity**

   Laughter has been found to boost resilience. A study evaluating humor induced [**positive psychology interventions**](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-psychology-interventions/) identified the benefits of incorporating daily humor activities to induce laughter reduced depression and increased joy for participants, even months later \(Wellenzohn, et. al., 2016\).

Spend 10 minutes each day for 7 days on the following exercise:

1. Write down the three of the funniest things you have experienced, seen, or heard that day. Provide detail and note how they made you feel. If you can’t think of anything, do an online search for funny stories or anecdotes. Social media can be a good source for funny material. \
2. Write down why you found it funny. The more specific you are, the more effective the exercise will be. \
3. Write these three funny things at the end of your day. Doing so will foster a new [**habit**](https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-exercises/) and may help you absorb the emotion more as you are going to sleep.

## Pitches and Presentations \(Read, Write, Hear, Do\)‌

1. Take your notes and turn them into a one-minute talk :

   * what worries you
   * how you’ll beat that 
   * what you’ll achieve
   * what you want to do after graduation

    Make sure you follow the guide presented in the workshop

2. Pair-off with another trainee that has a different work-style to yours based on the Leadership Compass. 
3. Organise a time to work together. 
4. You will then ‘pitch’ your to each other  your 1 minute talks. 

   Make sure to include what action you have taken so far and what help you still need.

5. Give each other feedback on your pitches. 
6. Prepare to present feedback at next PD Class.
