#### **Lesson**

Link to slides to be added once saved in the correct place‌.

Teaching notes added to slides.

Where possible give real world examples – maybe you and your team have had success or have overcome a challenge by identifying leadership style?

The main element of the session is the exercise and subsequent discussion. The exercise aims demonstrate we are all different – such as how we give and receive instruction, how we motivate and encourage, how we measure success in ourselves and others… and this will form the main area of discussion after the trainees have completed the exercise.

You can add a competitive element such as the first team to complete the task wins if you feel this works with your group.

As the exercise is timed the workshop lead will need to make sure the trainees are aware at regular intervals specifically start and end of 2 minutes prep and start of 6 minutes for the objects.

The exercise:

**The aim of the exercise is for you and your team to find 4 items in 6 minutes or less.**

1. 1 member will describe an object of their choosing without mentioning its name and the other 3 team members will need to identify what it is and find it.
2. You only need to find one per team.
3. You have a maximum of 6 minutes to find all the items.
4. Repeat step 1 until each member of the team has had a turn at describing an item
5. You will be allocated a breakout room in a team of 4
6. You have 2 minutes to prepare how you plan to complete the task as a team, but this must include choosing your object for your teammates to find.
7. This will be a timed exercise and the breakout rooms will automatically close at the end
8. If you finish the exercise before the breakout rooms close, please rejoin the main room

Some tips for the trainees:

Remember - Don’t tell your team what your item is; they have to guess.

Keep it simple and use items that are easy to find and likely to be nearby \(pen, phone, book, notepad, mug, glasses, keyboard etc\).

Keep an eye on the time.

#### **Common Mistakes / Misconceptions**

1. You will need to reinforce that although the session is called leadership compass you do not need to be a manager to lead.
2. Make sure you address the negative thinking that some people may have.
3. This is not relevant to me – teamwork and personal growth.  
4. I don’t have to learn this now – it will help with working with other trainees.
5. I will only be a junior so I won’t be able to change anything – Leaders aren’t just managers – remind about roles in tech and how members of teams may need to lead certain elements of a project.

#### **Guided Practice**

All instructions and questions are added to the slide notes to facilitate conversation and discussion.

#### **Independent Practice**

Ideas for what they could do outside of class.

* How can you build on the skills to help you adapt to others around you?

#### **Challenge or Additional resources**
