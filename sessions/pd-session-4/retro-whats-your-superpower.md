# Retro - What's your Superpower?

In the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) by Diana Larsen and Esther Derby, the authors explain a retrospective as having the following steps:

* **Set the Stage**: make sure everyone feels safe and is in in the retro
* **Gather The Data**: what happened, make sure everyone has the same picture
* **Generate Insights**: analyze the data to find root causes
* **Decide What To Do**: what are experiments that could help us to improve [1% a day](https://agilestrides.com/blog/113-practices-of-extreme-programming-applied-to-management/)
* **Closing**: don’t just walk away but close the retro with an activity

For every step you can use an activity. 

1. **Set the Stage**:

  
   **Your Superpower** \(Use online whiteboard like Miro, or Google Jamboard to post answers\)

  
   Using Superheroes as a theme for your retro, ask the question:. What is your superpower? What skill or competence do you bring with you to the team?  
  
   Ask participants to write their superpower on a sticky note and in short explain it when necessary.  

2. **Gather the Data:**  
  
   **Superhero** \(This is basically the same activity as for example Liked, Learned, Longed For, but by using different terms and images to challenge participants and keep it fun.\) You can use an online retro board for this like Metro Retro or 

  
   What do you think was super \(use Superman image\)?   
  
   What do you think was strange \(use Dr. Strange image\)?   
  
   What do you think was bad \(use Batman image\)?   
  
   What didn’t you dare to do \(Use daredevil image\)?



  

3. Generate Insights:  Using the data gathered in the Superhero step, discuss what were the causes for why thing went wrong? 
4. Decide what to do:  
  
   **SMART Actions \(Use whiteboard Miro or Jamboard\)**   


   Use this activity to help the group define their actions. Just another format.

   In this case, you can use this template to help the team define SMART actions. 

   It's also a practical way for trainees to learn about SMART goal setting.

  
  
   In order to &lt;reach our goal&gt; we will &lt;do an action&gt; before &lt;a point in time&gt;. We will know we are successful when &lt;measure of the result happens&gt;. 

5. Closing:   
   Team Super Powers

   Ask the team to write down what they think is the superpower of the team. A positive closing of the retrospective.

#### Your Superpower \(Use online whiteboard like Miro, or Google Jamboard or Retro board like Metroretro or 

Using Superheroes as a theme for your retro, ask the question:. What is your superpower? What skill or competence do you bring with you to the team?

Ask participants to write their superpower on a sticky note and in short explain it when necessary.



2. Then you can use the following activity for the Gather the Data stage:

#### Superhero

What do you think was super \(use Superman image\)? What do you think was strange \(use Dr. Strange image\)? What do you think was bad \(use Batman image\)? What didn’t you dare to do \(Use daredevil image\)?

Yes, I know Batman is written with an t.

This is basically the same activity as for example Liked, Learned, Longed For, but by using different terms and pictures you challenge the team and keep it fun.

3. You can use the following activity for the Decide what to do step:

#### SMART Actions

Another flip chart that describes how the team can define their actions. Just another format.

In this case, you can use the template at the bottom of the flip chart to help the team define SMART actions.

It's also a practical way for trainees to learn about SMART goal setting.

4. Finally for the closing step you can use this activity: 

#### Team Super Powers

Ask the team to write down what they think is the superpower of the team. A positive closing of the retrospective.
