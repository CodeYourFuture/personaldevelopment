# Retro - What's your Superpower?

In the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) by Diana Larsen and Esther Derby, the authors explain a retrospective as having the following steps:

* **Set the Stage**: make sure everyone feels safe and is involved in the retro
* **Gather The Data**: what happened, make sure everyone has the same picture
* **Generate Insights**: analyze the data to find root causes
* **Decide What To Do**: what are experiments that could help us to improve [1% a day](https://agilestrides.com/blog/113-practices-of-extreme-programming-applied-to-management/)
* **Closing**: don’t just walk away but close the retro with an activity

Remeber that your retro is covering the past 4 week and should keep the focus on their soft skill development including teamwork, communication, 

**Set the Stage**:

**Your Superpower** \(Use online whiteboard like Miro, or Google Jamboard to post answers\)

  
Using Superheroes as a theme for your retro, ask the question:  
  
What is your superpower?   
What skill or competence do you bring with you to the group?  
  
Ask participants to write their superpower on a sticky note or text box and explain why they chose that particular trait or skill.  
  
  


**Gather the Data:**

**Superhero** \(This is basically the same activity as for example Liked, Learned, Longed For, but by using different terms and images to challenge participants and keep it fun.\) You can use an online retro board for this like [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io) or [Easyretro](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/hWBjp6dsAwfq8IR3trAaYhDCcmJ3/4b2b3322-96af-4861-b900-15aad60cc3b6)\)   
  
  
What do you think was super \(use Superman image\)?   
  
What do you think was strange \(use Dr. Strange image\)?   
  
What do you think was bad \(use Batman image\)?   
  
What didn’t you dare to do \(Use daredevil image\)?  


#### **Generate Insights**:  

Using the data gathered in the Superhero step, discuss what were the causes for why things went wrong?  


**Decide what to do**:  
  
**SMART Actions \(Use whiteboard Miro or Jamboard\)**   


Use this activity to help the group define their actions for the next module. 

In this case, you can use this template to help the team define SMART actions. 

It's also a practical way for trainees to learn about SMART goal setting.

**Template:**  
In order to &lt;reach our goal&gt; we will &lt;do an action&gt; before &lt;a point in time&gt;. We will know we are successful when &lt;measure of the result happens&gt;. 



**Closing:**

**Team Super Powers**

As a positive closing of the retrospective,

Ask the group to write down what they think is the superpower of the team.
