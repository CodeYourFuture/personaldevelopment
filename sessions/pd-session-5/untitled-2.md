#### **Teaching notes and walkthrough**

#### **Slides 2**

#### **Slides 3- x**‌

When you are ready to apply for jobs there is a cycle you will go through for each job.

If you do this process you won't have to apply for hundreds of unsuitable jobs. You will be more strategic and apply for fewer jobs but have a better chance of success.

Searching for jobs that are the right fit for you - Last PD day you learned about the wide variety of tech jobs. Not all of them are developer roles.

You should have researched and have some idea of the types of jobs you want to go for after the course.

Rearching companies

Taking apart the job advert and really understanding the role

Making a CV that fits just this job

Letting us know at CYF what job and company you want to apply. So we can help you get your foot in the door. We will go to them and apply on your behalf.

Preparing for interviews with your Career Mentor

Asking for feedback after your interview can help you see what they see about you

Waiting for an answer! Don’t waste your time- keep applying and interviewing. You never know what role will be the best for you.

#### **Slides 4- 5 The company**

Do your research on the company. Learn about them and connect with their employees who have the job you are currently looking at. Find out from them what it is really like. So you can answer for yourself if you would want to do this job for this company?

#### **Slides 8-9 The Role**

Understand the role. Do you know what they are asking for? What is their need? What can you help them with?

#### **Slide 10- Activity What is the company? 15 mins**

**In small groups read the following ‘About Us’ document an answer the following:**

1. What is interesting about this company?
2. What do you want to know more about?
3. What kind of working environment do you think they have? 
4. Do you think this company would be a good fit for you in culture and values? 
5. Why or why not? 

#### **Slide 11- Activity What is the role? 20 mins**

**In small groups read one of the the following job specs and answer the following:**

1. Do you understand all the responsibilities required for this role?
2. Do you think you would enjoy this work?
3. Do you have past experiences that match what they are looking for? 

As a group, summarise what the job is:

What do you have to do?

What do you have to know?

What do you have to show?

Job Spec Company A

Job Spec Company B

#### **Slides 12-13 Make it Relevant**

When describing your work experience on your CV, always focus on the skillsets and behaviours you have demonstrated or gained.

**Slides 14- 15 Show, don’t tell** 

Ideally, include the measurable outcomes of the work you did. Who did your work help? What problems did it solve?

**Slides 16 Recap** 

Recap the steps to the job application cycle.

Address the common mistakes/ misconception

Allow time for discussion

#### **Common Mistakes / Misconceptions**

‌

1. I don’t care what job I get, I just need a job. 
2. This cycle takes too much time. I don’t have the time to look for a job this way. 
3. Why do I need a different CV for every job if I’m just applying for a junior developer role? 
4. I didn’t spend all this time learning to code to not be able to get a job at the end.
