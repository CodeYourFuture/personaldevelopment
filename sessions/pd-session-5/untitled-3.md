**Slide Stack Overflow**

* Share knowledge which shows how well you understand tech concepts
* Recruiters are aware that not everyone is on LinkedIn and they explore other places where they can find great developers
* Reputation gained in Stack Overflow is more testament than CVs or LinkedIn profile

Stack Overflow is a **Q&A site.** More than 50 million unique visitors come to Stack Overflow every month. It is part of a larger group called Stack Exchange Network

Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted **online community for developers** to learn and share their knowledge

**Slide Stack Overflow**

Contributing to others code shows your willingness to be part of the global developer community

Recruiters use Github to see your code.  They can see everything that you do.  With a final project or a personal website there is no real way to know if you have done the front end or the back end or the design – how many users there are ? Not so good metric vs github - can see everything

**Slide Github**

**So the principle here is: don't say anything you wouldn't say face to face. This doesn't mean you can't disagree. But disagree without calling names. If you're right, your argument will be more convincing without them.** 

**The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your comment teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned, and by giving more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience.** 

**Users are asked to make thoughtful comments. Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial.**

**What does "deeply interesting" mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world.** 

**Stories on HN don't have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren't only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.**

**HN says there are two rules: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.**

**Users can post articles and comment on articles** 

**According to Wikipedia HN is a** [**social news website**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_news_website) **focusing on** [**computer science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) **and** [**entrepreneurship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company)**.
