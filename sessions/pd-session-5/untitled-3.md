#### **Slides 3 Social Media for Job search**

Using social media platforms for job search can increase your visibility for your professional profile to a greater audience.

It gives you the opportunity to network with others in your chosen field.

You can gain insightful ****information that you wouldn’t have access to otherwise.

There are some social media platforms that are known for professional networking such as LinkedIn and meetup.   However there are others that are somewhat unconventional but could be potentially as effective as the previous ones if used in the right way.

The purpose of today is to explore these different types of social media platforms and how you can utilise them to help your job searc and improve your visibility as a developer.

The content that we will be discussing today will be very useful in your journey but it's just the start. 

We know from experience that people who use these platforms have a higher degree of exposure to hiring people.

But it’s important that it is used in the right way.   Because if you don’t it can work against you.

There is no one specific way of using these platforms however there are certain pitfalls you should avoid.

Don’t discuss controversial topics on these platforms, or anything that would be against professional ethics and immoral.

**Slides 4 LinkedIn**

What is LinkedIn?

What is it good for and how can trainees use it for their job search.

**Activity \(2 mins\) - Do a poll using Zoom to see how many people have a LinkedIn profile already**

**Slides 5-7 SM examples** 

‌‌Some examples of LinkedIn profiles and posts

**Slide 8 Twitter for job search**

Use Twitter to search for jobs, research companies and employees to network with

**Slide 9 Twitter for personal brand**

_On Twitter you can create an impression of your personality and interests_

Post about things that are interesting to you

Link to other sites like your LinkedIn profile or your personal website

Change your DM settings so that anyone can contact you

**Slide 10 People on Twitter** 

Lots of people in tech on Twitter!

Learn lots from how others present themselves

**Activity \(10 mins\): Write great bio under 160 characters remember to use keywords to make yourself searchable for employers**

**Slide 11 Hashtags on Twitter**

When you use a **hashtag** in a Tweet, it becomes linked to all of the other **Tweets** that include it. Including a **hashtag** gives a Tweet context and can give a conversation longevity.

**Slide 17-18 Hackernews**

According to Wikipedia HN is a [social news website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_news_website) focusing on [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [entrepreneurship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company). It is part of Y Combinator one of the most influential tech startup incubators in the world. 

Users can post articles and comment on articles 

HN says there are two rules: don't post or upvote crap links, and don't be rude or dumb in comment threads.

Stories on HN don't have to be about hacking, because good hackers aren't only interested in hacking, but they do have to be deeply interesting.

What does "deeply interesting" mean? It means stuff that teaches you about the world. 

Users are asked to make thoughtful comments. Thoughtful in both senses: civil and substantial.

The test for substance is a lot like it is for links. Does your comment teach us anything? There are two ways to do that: by pointing out some consideration that hadn't previously been mentioned, and by giving more information about the topic, perhaps from personal experience. 

So the principle here is: don't say anything you wouldn't say face to face. This doesn't mean you can't disagree. But disagree without calling names. If you're right, your argument will be more convincing without them. 

**Slide 19 Jobsearch exercise - 20 minutes**

* Divide into small groups
  * Each group assigned a SM platform \(LinkedIn, Twitter, Meetup, Hackernews\)
  * Decide on the search terms you will use
  * Search for jobs 
  * Find 2 unique jobs per team member
  * Post the job posts on thread in Slack
* Feed back on
  * How did you decide which search terms to use?
  * How effective were your searches? 
  * How many jobs did you find?
  * What would you do differently?

Can give guidance on how to do search on Twitter for example:  In your breakout room search for job posts on twitter using this search criteria ⇒ _\(developer OR Engineer\) AND \(job OR role\) lang:en near:"London" within:30mi_ 

_You can change the location but know that certain location might not have a lot of options_

**Slide 21-22 Instagram**

When you think of social media and personal branding you will probably think about Instagram.

You can use Instagram to establish your personal brand

By creating content related to your interests in tech

You can also use it to follow companies and influencers

You can also research, interact and network with companies

Some examples of people posting about tech on Instagram

**Slide Github**

Recruiters use Github to see your code.  They can see everything that you do.  With a final project or a personal website there is no real way to know if you have done the front end or the back end or the design – how many users there are ? Not so good metric vs github - can see everything

Contributing to others code shows your willingness to be part of the global developer community

Helps you learn / practice how to write code

**Slide Stack Overflow**

Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted **online community for developers** to learn and share their knowledge

Stack Overflow is a **Q&A site.** More than 50 million unique visitors come to Stack Overflow every month. It is part of a larger group called Stack Exchange Network

* Share knowledge which shows how well you understand tech concepts
* Recruiters are aware that not everyone is on LinkedIn and they explore other places where they can find great developers
* Reputation gained in Stack Overflow is more testament than CVs or LinkedIn profile

**Slide Stack Overflow**

Good answers are voted up and **rise to the top**. _The best answers show up first so that they are always easy to find._

Strict rules of how write a question and answer

Good question =&gt; Specific programming problems

Bad Questions =&gt; Questions you haven't _tried_ to find an answer for \(show your work!\)

You earn reputation when people vote on your posts. As you earn reputation, you'll [unlock new privileges like](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges) the ability to vote, comment, and even edit other people's posts.

Badges are special achievements you earn for participating on the site. They come in three levels: bronze, silver, and gold. You get a specific badge when you perform a task like creating a profile, achieving an accepted answer with a certain score, etc there is a list.
