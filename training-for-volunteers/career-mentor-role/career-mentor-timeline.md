# Career Mentor Timeline

You will start your role as a Career Mentor by doing  competency based mock interviews with 2 trainees from a CYF class.   
  
This helps you get a sense of the skills and personalities in the class. You get an idea of what your potential mentee may need to work improving for their own job search.   


Then you will have a Career Mentor Briefing session with the other Career mentors in your city/region.  This should take 1-1.5 hours. We will cover the material here as well as highlight the skills we think you can support your mentee to develop.   
  
After the Career Mentor Briefing, we will match you with your two mentees. The trainees will apply for a mentor based on the information you provide in your mentoring application. They will have to write an essay saying who they choose and what they think they could learn from you.   
  
A week or so later, we will facilitate your first meeting with your mentees. This will be either during their weekend class \(on Saturday in most cities, but Sunday in London\) or during a weeknight evening.   
  
Once you get started with your mentees you will be added to our \#cyf-career-mentors  channel on our Slack workspace. This will enable you to connect with all the other mentors in our regions. It is also the primary way we will communicate with all of you. If you prefer email, please do let us know when you apply.   
  
We suggest you have your mentoring sessions in group sessions. This will encourage your mentees to work with each other and support one another. It also helps you use your time more effectively.
