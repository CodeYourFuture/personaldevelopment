# Career Mentor Timeline

You will start your role as a Career Mentor by doing  competency based mock interviews with 2 trainees from a CYF class.   
  
This helps you get a sense of the skills and personalities in the class. You get an idea of what your potential mentee may need to work improving for their own job search.   


Then you will have a Career Mentor Briefing session with the other Career mentors in your city/region.  This should take 1-1.5 hours. We will cover the material here as well as highlight the skills we think you can support your mentee to develop.   
  
After the Career Mentor Briefing, you will be matched with your two mentees. The trainees will choose who they would like to work with and what they think they could learn from you.   
  
A week or so later, we will facilitate your first meeting with your mentees. This will be either during their weekend class \(on Saturday in most cities, but Sunday in London\) or during a weeknight evening.
