        <p><b>Your first meeting with your mentee</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ideally your mentee should have gotten in contact with you to set the
            date/ time / video call platform for your mentoring session.</li>
          <li>You might feel a bit nervous about your first meeting but don&#x2019;t
            worry about it &#x2013; a lot of people do. You might be thinking, &#x2018;How
            will we start?&#x2019; or &#x2018;What are we going to talk about?&#x2019;</li>
          <li>It&#x2019;s a good idea to devote some thought to your first meeting because
            it&#x2019;s extremely important. If you get off to a good start, everything
            else should be much easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Starting the first meeting</b>
        </p>
        <p>To get started, you could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>make yourselves comfortable:</b> have a drink for yourself and suggest
            they have one too, sit in a comfortable space, get to know each other</li>
          <li><b>tell your mentee something about yourself:</b> this could include information
            about your personal life as well as your professional life &#x2013; whatever
            feels right for you</li>
          <li><b>explain why you got involved with CodeYourFuture&#x2019;s Career Mentoring Program:</b> for
            example, talk about how you might do together and what you both might get
            out of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Remember: </b>if you don&#x2019;t hit it off straight away, don&#x2019;t
          panic. It takes time to build any relationship and it will get easier the
          more you meet because you&#x2019;ll build up trust and get used to each
          other.</p>
        <p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</p>
        <p><b>What is the first meeting for?</b>
        </p>
        <p>The first meeting is all about getting your relationship off to a good
          start by establishing some ground rules and acknowledging that the relationship
          is two-way. This is also the best time to agree about what you hope to
          achieve, and share your expectations with one another.</p>
        <p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</p>
        <p><b>We recommend you cover the mentee&#x2019;s ambitions and goals in relation to:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>particular issues they face</li>
          <li>their achievements so far and how to build on them</li>
          <li>realistic expectations for type of role, company, salary</li>
          <li>scale of priorities (learning tech skills, professional skills, finding
            a job)</li>
          <li>areas in which they would find input most useful</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>You should also cover a few basic essentials:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>when you would like to meet &#x2013; how often and for how long</li>
          <li>vehicle for follow-up meetings (Zoom, Hangouts, Slack, phone call)</li>
          <li>how you will keep in touch (by email and or Slack) and how you will remind
            each other of future meetings.</li>
          <li>discussing and agreeing how you will work together</li>
          <li>confidentiality vs privacy (the content of your meetings is private; your
            mentee will have control over how any of their information is shared)</li>
          <li>responsibilities of mentor and mentee</li>
          <li>how you will record progress and issues/targets for further development
            (<b>both mentor and mentee</b> please use the <a href="https://forms.gle/z1BXaXstS3SHL1My8">Career Mentoring Feedback Form</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>KEY PRINCIPLES IN BUILDING TRUST</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Get to know your mentee.  </b>Talk about their studies at CYF and their
            life outside it. Try to understand what they think and why. Value their
            viewpoint.</li>
          <li><b>Do what you say you are going to do.  </b>Agree what you are aiming
            to achieve through your mentoring sessions. Be reliable and always do what
            you say you are going to do.</li>
          <li><b>Communicate openly and honestly.</b> Discuss issues as soon as they
            arise. Ask for and give feedback.</li>
          <li><b>Don&#x2019;t be afraid to challenge.</b> Your open, honest relationship
            will allow you to challenge your mentee constructively to explore a wider
            viewpoint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taking time to build rapport with your mentee will help you to get the
          most from the mentoring relationship. Rapport comes from shared values
          or experiences, and sometimes from a &#x2018;chemistry&#x2019; that is
          hard to define.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One sign that there is comfort or rapport between two people is that they
          have similar tone of voice, body language, movements and so on. As you
          will be meeting via video or phone call, observing body languauge can be
          more challenging. But think about how you can make the call an intimate
          space.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can you present ypurself in a way that they can see your body postures?</li>
          <li>Can you sak them to do the same?</li>
          <li>Can they see your hand movements?</li>
          <li>What do their faces tell you, especially their expressions?</li>
          <li>Do you have moods seem similar?</li>
          <li>How similar are their voices?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most barriers to effective mentoring stem from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personality issues</li>
          <li>Lack of awareness of the roles of the mentor and mentee</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Common barriers include</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor mentor/mentee matching</li>
          <li>Mentor or mentee dissatisfaction about the way the mentoring is conducted</li>
          <li>Unrealistic expectations about what mentoring can achieve</li>
          <li>The lack/blurring of boundaries in the mentor/mentee relationship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can help you to overcome any barriers you may encounter.</p>
        <p><b>Challenges facing your mentee may include:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Being more time efficient</li>
          <li>Having confidence</li>
          <li>Having low self esteem</li>
          <li>Having little or no work experience in UK</li>
          <li>Having little knowledge of tech work culture</li>
          <li>Low level of English reading, writing and speaking</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Confidentiality</b>
        </p>
        <p>It&#x2019;s really important that you respect each other&#x2019;s confidentiality.
          Remember that anything you talk about when you meet up is between the two
          of you so you shouldn&#x2019;t talk about it to someone else. But, legally,
          you should report any criminal conduct or possible harassment or bullying.
          Speak to your mentoring lead if you&#x2019;re worried about anything like
          this.</p>
        <p><b>Four things to think about are:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Concerns</b>. If you&#x2019;ve got any, chat to the the PD team or
            other Mentors in the #cyf- career- mentors Slack channel</li>
          <li><b>Secrets.</b> Don&#x2019;t promise to keep any secrets. Make that clear
            from the beginning and remember to ask your mentee if they mind you sharing
            confidential information with anyone else.</li>
          <li><b>Information.</b> Keep information about your mentee (like their phone
            number) somewhere secure.</li>
          <li><b>You.</b> Confidentiality works both ways. Be aware of those personal
            areas of your life you&#x2019;re happy to share with your mentee and those
            you are not.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Getting Started with Mentoring:**</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find out where your mentee needs support</li>
          <li>Agree goals that they can work towards</li>
          <li>Gauge how you are doing</li>
          <li>Keep an eye on your goals</li>
          <li>Pat each other on the back for your successes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don&#x2019;t forget, goals are most useful when they are <b>SMART</b>:</p>
        <p><b>Specific</b> &#x2013; for example, rather than &#x2018;get a website&#x2019;,
          say &#x2018;choose a suitable domain name for my business&#x2019;.</p>
        <p><b>Measureable &#x2013; </b>Decide how you&#x2019;ll know when you&#x2019;ve
          achieved it.</p>
        <p><b>Achievable</b> &#x2013; Can you do it?</p>
        <p><b>Realistic</b> &#x2013; Do you think you have a real prospect of reaching
          your goal?</p>
        <p><b>Timed</b> &#x2013; Is this a long-term or short-term goal? Agree timescales
          for each goal &#x2013; you won&#x2019;t be able to get everything done
          at once. To structure a coaching or mentoring session using the <b>GROWS Model</b>,
          take the following steps:</p>
        <p>First, you and your mentee need to look at the behavior they want to change,
          and then structure this change as a <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/page6.html"><b>goal</b></a> they
          want to achieve.</p>
        <p>Make sure that this is a SMART goal: one that is Specific, Measurable,
          Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.</p>
        <p>When doing this, it&apos;s useful to ask your mentee questions like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How will you know that you have achieved this goal?</li>
          <li>How will you know that the problem or issue is solved?</li>
          <li>Does this goal fit with your overall career objectives?</li>
          <li>And does it fit with the CYF employability objectives?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, ask your mentee to describe their current reality.</p>
        <p>This is an important step. Too often, people try to solve a problem or
          reach a goal without fully considering their starting point, and often
          they&apos;re missing some information that they need in order to reach
          their goal effectively.</p>
        <p>As your mentee tells you about their current reality, the solution may
          start to emerge.</p>
        <p>Useful coaching questions in this step include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is happening now (what, who, when, and how often)? What is the effect
            or result of this?</li>
          <li>Have you already taken any steps towards your goal?</li>
          <li>Does this goal conflict with any other goals or objectives?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you and your mentee have explored the current reality, it&apos;s
          time to determine what is possible &#x2013; meaning all of the possible
          options for reaching their objective.</p>
        <p>Help your mentee <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html"><b>brainstorm</b></a> as
          many good options as possible. Then, discuss these and help them decide
          on the best ones.</p>
        <p>By all means, offer your own suggestions in this step. But let your mentee
          offer suggestions first, and let them do most of the talking. It&apos;s
          important to guide in the right direction, without actually making decisions
          for them.Your mentee needs to own their choices.</p>
        <p>Typical questions that you can use to explore options are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What else could you do?</li>
          <li>What if this or that constraint were removed? Would that change things?</li>
          <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?</li>
          <li>What factors or considerations will you use to weigh the options?</li>
          <li>What do you need to stop doing in order to achieve this goal?</li>
          <li>What obstacles stand in your way?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By examining the current reality and exploring the options, your mentee
          will now have a good idea of how he can achieve his goal.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s great &#x2013; but in itself, this may not be enough. The
          next step is to get your mentee to commit to specific actions in order
          to move forward towards their goal. In doing this, you will help them establish
          their will and boost motivation.</p>
        <p>Useful questions to ask here include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>So, what will you do now, and when? What else will you do?</li>
          <li>What could stop you moving forward? How will you overcome this?</li>
          <li>How can you keep yourself motivated?</li>
          <li>When do you need to review progress? Daily, weekly, monthly?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, have your mentee identify who can help them with achieving their
          goal. It could be you or someone else within CYF. Have them think about
          who has helped them in the past as well as who they can connect with now
          to get help in the future. <b>6. Review Your Progress</b>
        </p>
        <p>You should make reviewing your progress a regular activity with your mentee.
          This will provide some accountability, and allow them to change their approach
          if the original plan isn&apos;t working. You can build this into the structure
          of your meetings where you start with a review of the goals set in your
          previous meeting.</p>
        <p>Some questions to use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How have you gotten on with your previous actions?</li>
          <li>What has gone well since our last session?</li>
          <li>What hasn&#x2019;t gone well since our last session?</li>
          <li>What have you learned since carrying out these actions?</li>
          <li>What would you do differently?</li>
          <li>What have you discovered about yourself?</li>
          <li>What challenges did you face?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Ending the mentoring relationship</b>
        </p>
        <p>There will come a time when the mentoring relationship will begin to draw
          to an end. We hope that you will be able to successfully work together
          until three months after their course ends. At this point you must both
          &#x2018;let go&#x2019; so that your mentee can maintain their independence.
          It will then become their responsibility to put what they have learned
          into practice. Although the two of you will probably continue to have some
          form of interaction, it should be on a more casual basis, where you consider
          each other as equals.</p>
        <p><b>Here are some tips to help you end your mentoring relationship successfully:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Fix a date for your final meeting.</b> Decide on a date with your mentee.
            Remind each other of this in your penultimate meeting so that you can prepare
            for it.</li>
          <li><b>Find other ways to support your mentee.</b> For instance, look at ways
            you can continue to support your mentee&#x2019;s learning.</li>
          <li><b>Celebrate your success.</b> Have a look at the goals you set when you
            first met. Consider what you have both achieved during the process and
            reflect on what you can take to your next mentoring relationship.</li>
          <li><b>Say goodbye.</b> End the session on a positive note so it&#x2019;s not
            awkward. You could talk about what you most enjoyed, what you&#x2019;ll
            remember most or the most important things you&#x2019;ve both learned.</li>
        </ul>
